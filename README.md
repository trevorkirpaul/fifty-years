  - [ ] implement redux-saga (only if needed)

I'm at a point where I cn start implementing actual game logic. I'll spend some time planning it out a little more but I have a great foundation to build on. My main goal has been to re-create Fifty Years but I also want to add on to it. Adding features like skills and other resources in order to increase re-playablity. I'd also like to add a loot-like system. Maybe rare specialy units that can sometimes spawn.
