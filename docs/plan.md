# Plan

This document will describe the outline for the game design.

## Main Goal

The main goal is to last 50 years as a community/village/army. As each year passes, 3 things will happen, of which are 2 types of occurences:

- good: can be a discovery made by a random villager, a shooting star or astronomical event, basically something that will increase a resource randomly

- bad: can be an attack from another army, a famine, a cult, a thief, ect

## Resources

There are 4 resources

- gold
- food
- research
- divinity

Gold can be used to build new buildings or pay off attackers.

Food will be depleted by your citizens but can also be bartered with. There will be some activities such as celebrations that will quickly deplete food for certain bonuses.

Research will be used to learn new skills. You will have access to a certain amount each year and it will refresh back to capacity each year.

Divinity will be gained if you follow a certain play style. It can be used like research but generally your play style can lean one way or the other.

## Land

The player can advance past 1 plot of land but each plot can have 9 tiles on which to build a selection of buildings.
